# CANOpen

** Do not expect quality code out of this repo. I am not very good at rust**

Implementing some basic CANOpen control functionality in rust. Builds upon the work being done in my [CANlib](https://www.github.com/parkermathis/CANlib) repo. 

Not all included functions may work as intended, this repo is a work in progress.

## Requirements
- Kvaser CANlib SDK: [website](https://kvaser.com/download/)
- Kvaser Drivers: [website](https://kvaser.com/download/)

the path to the canlib32 library must be included in your $PATH environment variable. On Windows the default location is: 
```C:\Program Files\Kvaser\Drivers\```
